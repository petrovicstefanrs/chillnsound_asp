# Chill N' Sound / ASP.NET 

Relax with the sounds of nature! Play and Mix Ambient sounds to boost concentration and productivity.  Chill n' Sound / ASP.NET is written with Vanilla JS and ASP.NET as backend, it is a clone of websites like Noisli or A soft murmur. You are free to fork or clone the project and create something with it. If you do make something let me know! I would like to check it out.

>Note:

This version of the Chill N' Sound is using ASP.NET for backend used for creating a light feature Admin Panel to control adding sounds and sound icons. You can also add new admins with admin panel, to allow other people to moderate the app.

>Note:

There is no live preview of this version as I don't have the means to host the app.
